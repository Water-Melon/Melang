Melang is a script Language of preemptive scheduling coroutine in single thread. It is only support on UNIX/Linux.

> Melang has already supported MySQL 8.0, but the newest MySQL C client library is unstable. So if trying to connect an unreachable address, a buffer-overflow will happened even though program may not crash. I have submitted bug report to MySQL community, no more news now.
